            In Blackjack, a card's rank is solely determined by its rank; its suit is of no importance.
            The cards numbered 2-10 have a rank equal to their rank. The Jack, Queen and King all have a rank of 10.
            Like most card games, the Ace occupies a special position: here, its rank depends on the hand that contains it.
            Wherever possible, the Ace has a rank equal to 11, the highest rank a single card can have.

        <p>
            Surprisingly, the lowest rank in the game is also attributed to the Ace: should an 11-valued Ace bring a hand's total rank over 21, the Ace's rank becomes 1.
            Thus, drawing an Ace can never cause a hand's rank to exceed 21.

        <p>
            This trait does not only apply to newly drawn Aces, but is applied retroactively as well: when a newly drawn non-Ace card would bring a hand's total rank over 21, if that hand contains an 11-valued ace, that Ace's rank becomes 1.
